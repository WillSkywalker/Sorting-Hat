# Sorting-Hat
The Sorting Hat from Harry Potter. For Python training purposes.

* * *

This is a training project designed for students with no programming background. We designed the content that gives you a thorough introduction to Python in eight lessons.

The project is divided into 8 units:

* unit1: Basic input/output; using `if`
* unit2: Define a function; Operators; `for` loops
* unit3: Data structures: `list` and `dict`
* unit4: Reading a file; indexing and mapping
* unit5: Using `import` for third part packages; loading JSON; list comprehension
* unit6: Package management; Exceptions
* unit7: Object-oriented programming; project structure
* unit8: GUI in Tkinter; threads

You may use `git checkout unit[1-8]` to choose a unit. For example, if you are teaching or learning from unit one, please type `git checkout unit1` in your terminal and press Enter.
